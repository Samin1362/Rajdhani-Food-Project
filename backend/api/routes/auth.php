 * /auth/* — section 9.2. Two audiences, one namespace.
 *
 * Which routes carry RequireAdmin is the security-relevant part of this file.
 * Login, refresh, forgot-password, reset-password and the invite pair are public
 * by necessity: the caller has no access token yet, which is the entire point of
 * asking. Each of those instead proves possession of something — a password, a
 * refresh cookie, an emailed single-use token — inside the service.
 *
 * Logout is public for the same reason and one more: a session whose access
 * token has already expired must still be able to end itself, or a user who
 * leaves a tab open overnight cannot log out.
