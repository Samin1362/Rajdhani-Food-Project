/**
 * Default rows in `settings` (doc 8.2).
 *
 * The table is a key/value store for the handful of values that are neither
 * secrets nor content: who gets notified about a submission, which analytics
 * ids are in use, how many products fill a page. Secrets stay in `.env`
 * (doc 15) — nothing here is credential material, because these values are
 * editable from the admin panel and readable by anyone who can reach it.
 *
 * Upserted rather than insert-if-absent for the *keys* only: a missing key would
 * make the reading code fall back to a hard-coded default, which is exactly the
 * behaviour this table exists to remove. Values default to empty and are set by
 * the client; because a key that already exists keeps its value, re-running adds
 * newly introduced keys without disturbing configured ones.
